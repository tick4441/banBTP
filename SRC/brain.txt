How different Windows store their boot splashes This document details my findings for how a few select major versions of Windows store the graphics that accompany their boot screens. This is NOT a tutorial for replacing boot splashes - this is technical information intended mostly for entertainment purposes, or for people interested in implementing their own hobby boot-graphic-replacement programs. Windows 1.01 The graphics are stored in WIN.COM in the last 2412 bytes of the file. There are two 268x18 2 bpp monochrome bitmaps that come immediately one after another. Each is 1206 bytes. The bitmaps have no header, no padding, and no color table, just raw data, scanlines one after another. Scanlines go top-to-bottom and bits represent pixels left-to-right. A 11 bit pair represents a white pixel, a 00 bit pair represents a dark blue pixel. I’m unsure what a 10 or 01 bit pair does or why the images are 2 bpp in the first place since they are monochrome… The two bitmaps combine at runtime to make a single graphic. The scanlines of the two are interleaved (one from the first, then one from the second, then one from the first again… etc) In other words, to make the two 18-scanline bitmaps from a single 36-scanline bitmap, take out every even scanline and stack them up, then do the same for the odd scanlines. For further research: In WIN.COM, I’m unsure if the first bitmap is for the even or odd scanlines of the final image. If you are so inclined, the text that appears on the boot screen is also stored in WIN.COM as plaintext, though I’m unsure if the strings are counted or null-terminated, and if a possible counter is in the file or not. (how it appears) (how it’s stored in memory) Windows 2.03 Works in exactly the same way as 1.01, though the stored graphic is different. Windows 3.1 The graphics are once again stored in WIN.COM. This time, the whole boot splash is a proper bitmap with a standard 40-byte BITMAPINFOHEADER header, starting at offset 0x43F0 and continuing to the end of the file. The bitmap is 355x425, at 4 bpp with a 16 color table (though only 8 colors seem to be used, the rest being all black), with BI_RLE4 compression. The exact colors in the table are: [indices 0-8] 0x000000 █ [index 9] 0x008000 █ [index 10] 0x3f87a3 █ [index 11] 0x0000ff █ [index 12] 0xff0000 █ [index 13] 0x3da0c7 █ [index 14] 0x77bed9 █ [index 15] 0xffff00 █ Since it is a regular bitmap, it can be saved and edited with standard image tools. Plus, the exact bitmap format does not need to be respected - you can change the color table, use all 16 colors, even change the dimensions of the image! You must keep it at 4 bpp, however, otherwise it will display incorrectly. Windows 95 (OSR A) The boot graphic is embedded in IO.SYS, a hidden system file in the root of the C: drive (or wherever the OS was installed). It is obscured by a custom proprietary compression scheme. The compressed data spans from offset 0x1B210 to offset 0x2B17A. With the help of this Windows ME IO.SYS decompressor, I have been able to fully reimplement the decompression and compression algorithms for at least this particular bitmap. However, none of this is necessary to use a different startup graphic. If a bitmap of a specific format is included in the root of the C: drive with the name LOGO.SYS, Windows 95 will use that graphic instead of the one embedded in IO.SYS. LOGO.SYS must be a 320x400 8 bpp bitmap. Even though sources on the internet say the bitmap is RLE compressed, it does not have to have BI_RLE8 compression, and in fact the embedded IO.SYS graphic is not RLE compressed! Note that the bitmap is taller than it is wide. At runtime, it is horizontally stretched from a 4:5 ratio to a 4:3 ratio, (i.e., from 320x400 to 640x480). The animation of the loading stripes scrolling across the bottom of the image is partially defined by the bitmap itself. The last 20 colors in the color table will be rotated through at runtime, so any part of the bitmap using those colors is animated. This animation feature relies on a very rarely used field, biClrImportant (4 bytes at file offset 0x32) being set in the bitmap header. The number in this field is the number of colors that stay fixed, so for instance if it is set to 236, then the first 236 colors appear as normal and the final 256 - 236 = 20 colors will be cycled through. If it’s set to 256, no animation will occur at all. If it’s set to 1, you will get a rainbow rave dance party. Most image editors seem to just discard this information entirely because it is practically never used, so after saving your bitmap with something like GIMP, you’ll have to edit it with a hex editor to restore the biClrImportant field. Windows 98 (First Edition) The graphics format, animation, and LOGO.SYS trick all work the same as in Windows 95. IO.SYS is laid out slightly differently. The compressed data appears to be at offset 0x1E030 - 0x2E285 this time. The stored graphic is also obviously different, though the format is the same. Windows ME Once again, the graphics format, animation, and LOGO.SYS trick all work the same as in Windows 95. However, the IO.SYS situation is somewhat different. Rather than just compressing the bitmap in IO.SYS as in 9x, the entire file is compressed, using a very similar compression scheme as for the 9xs’ logos. A tool exists for uncompressing this file here (note the expired https certificate, but the program is safe at the time of writing this). Once uncompressed, the bitmap is indeed easily discoverable and replaceable. The uncompressed (and edited) IO.SYS can be used in place of the compressed one, Windows ME will handle it all the same. Windows 2000 (Professional RTM) The boot graphic is stored as an embedded resource in NTOSKRNL.EXE. This is a standard Windows PE executable and the graphic is embedded in a completely standard way, so there are many tools available that can easily access and modify the graphic, such as Resource Hacker. In the PE file, the bitmap is identified with an ID of 1. The graphic itself is once again a Windows bitmap. It is 640x480, at 4 bpp with a 16 color table, all 16 colors being used, using BI_RLE4 compression. The colors in the color table are: [index 0] 0x000000 █ [index 1] 0x00299c █ [index 2] 0x3a6ea5 █ [index 3] 0x0073de █ [index 4] 0x808080 █ [index 5] 0xd85a00 █ [index 6] 0xd73b00 █ [index 7] 0x0099ff █ [index 8] 0xefbe9a █ [index 9] 0xc0c0c0 █ [index 10] 0xff3300 █ [index 11] 0x008600 █ [index 12] 0xffce00 █ [index 13] 0x282820 █ [index 14] 0xd85e00 █ [index 15] 0xffffff █ Like with Windows 3.1, you can change this table and use any 16 colors you want. However, the bitmap must remain at 640x480 and 4 bpp, or it will display incorrectly. Rows 416-426 of the bitmap make up the blue bar that scrolls to the right while the bootsplash displays. They are simply animated at runtime by shifting the pixels of the rows, so unlike 9x, there is no need for special color table setups or anything. Windows XP (Professional SP2 x86) The boot graphic can be found in the exact same place as Windows 2000 (embedded PE resource in NTOSKRNL.EXE, Bitmap with an ID of 1) Once again, it is 640x480 at 4 bpp. It appears completely black because the 16 entries of the color table are all 0x000000, however, all the bitmap data is there, and can be seen if the color table is manually replaced. The all-black color table seems to be to support the fade-in animation of the graphic at runtime - the bitmap being all black hides the graphic initially until Windows is ready to fade it in, at which point it starts replacing the color table to show colors and cause the fade-in effect. This means that if you replace the table with colors of your own, they will only appear briefly when the graphic is initially loaded, and will be swiftly replaced by the default colors. The color table that Windows appears to use at runtime is: [index 0] 0x000000 █ [index 1] 0x201a15 █ [index 2] 0x464646 █ [index 3] 0x2d3ed2 █ [index 4] 0x536501 █ [index 5] 0xb2e505 █ [index 6] 0x7e7e7e █ [index 7] 0x899200 █ [index 8] 0x5e7ffc █ [index 9] 0xf76b20 █ [index 10] 0x8da6ff █ [index 11] 0x8edc04 █ [index 12] 0xf3bc1b █ [index 13] 0xbcbcbc █ [index 14] 0xfcfcfc █ [index 15] 0xffffff █ (unused in the original bitmap) If you want to make a bitmap to replace the one in NTOSKRNL, you’ll need to use exactly these colors in exactly this order. Alternatively, you can also patch NTOSKRNL to replace this color table. The table is located near the beginning of the .data section in the PE file - it consists of 16 BGRA byte tuples at offset 0x208 from the start of the section (0x75d08 physical offset in the whole file.) However, it is also possible to replace the bitmap through a non-destructive method, similar to the LOGO.SYS trick in Windows 9x. If you make any 16-color 640x480 bitmap, you can name it boot.bmp, put it in the WINDOWS folder, and then add /bootlogo /noguiboot to the entry for Windows XP in the boot.ini file in the root of your installation drive. Then Windows will use your graphic when booting instead of the default one. While this method doesn’t require patching NTOSKRNL, you will no longer get the loading animation of the rotating bars, plus the graphic will no longer fade in from black when booting, it will just sit statically until boot is done. Windows Vista (Home Premium RTM x86) There are two components to Vista’s boot splash: the “booting” screen, which is almost entirely black with a green scrolling loading bar, and the post-boot orb, which is a simple animation of a Vista logo getting all shiny. Although it’s much less flashy, the booting screen actually works in exactly the same way as Windows XP’s, down to using the same color table (though of course, most of the colors are now unused.) It is stored in the exact same place in NTOSKRNL.EXE. Worth noting: Unlike XP, Vista will get upset if you tamper with NTOSKRNL.EXE, as it will cause the digital signature in the file to become invalid. You can get around this once per boot by pressing F8 and choosing “Disable driver signature enforcement.” There doesn’t seem to be a reliable way to disable driver signature enforcement permanently. For further research: Since the operating system is over 15 years old, there is almost certainly a well-known way to forge the digital signature and make Vista accept your hacked NTOSKRNL, but I didn’t bother looking into that for this project. The post-boot orb resources are stored in authui.dll. The graphics for it are under the IMAGE resource type and are actually PNG files rather than bitmaps. IDs 17000 - 17004 make up the animation, with each of the five images being sequentially displayed one over another. For further research: I’m not 100% sure, but it seems fully black pixels become transparent at runtime, allowing you to see the previous images under the new ones. This file either doesn’t have a signature or it isn’t checked at boot time, so it can be tampered with freely. There’s also a so-called “secret” boot screen you can toggle by opening msconfig.exe, going to the “Boot” tab, and checking “No GUI boot.” This will display a static image with the text “Starting Windows Vista” instead of the usual bitmap with a fade-in and scrolling loading bar. The resources for this appear to be in winload.exe, stored as bitmaps in a WIM image which is itself stored in the executable as an RCData resource with ID 1. To edit the WIM image, I had success using the imagex tool from the Windows Vista Automated Installation Kit. The copy of DISM on my Windows 10 machine doesn’t seem to work well, perhaps because this is such an old WIM format. For further research: However, editing this file causes Vista to reject the boot process entirely, without the possibility of disabling signature enforcement. So, I don’t know if this actually works.

 Thanks. I did my best.

 Mac and cheese, no contest.
 Fire choice.
 Yours?
 Instant noodles lol.

 You wear socks to sleep?
 Nah, that’s cursed.
 Thank you. Finally someone agrees.
 Bare feet supremacy.

 Ever stayed up all night?
 Too many times. Brain melted.
 Night owl gang.
 For real.

 Do you keep a journal?
 Nah, I just vent to my notes app.
 Modern solutions.
 Exactly.

 You believe in ghosts?
 I want to, but also no thanks.
 Same. They’re cool in movies only.
 Facts.

 Favorite app right now?
 BeReal. It’s chaotic fun.
 I keep forgetting to post.
 Same lol.

 What would your dream vacation be?
 Japan. Food, culture, all of it.
 That’s on my list too.
 Let’s manifest it.

 You draw or paint?
 I doodle, mostly in class.
 That counts.
 It’s my focus method.

 You ever get random motivation at 1am?
 Yes! And then it’s gone by morning.
 Why is that so real?
 It’s a mystery.

 Favorite season?
 Fall. The vibe is unbeatable.
 I like summer more.
 That’s fair.

 What’s your go-to outfit?
 Hoodie and sweats. Always.
 Can’t go wrong with that.
 Cozy forever.

 You ever forget what day it is?
 Literally all the time.
 I thought today was Friday.
 It’s Tuesday 💀

 Have you ever made a YouTube video?
 Yeah, it was cringe.
 We’ve all been there.
 Archive footage now.

 What’s your go-to emoji?
 🫠 or 😭
 Solid picks.
 They say it all.

 What would your superpower be?
 Teleportation. No more traffic.
 Genius.
 Yours?
 Time travel, probably.

 You like horror movies?
 Only if I’m with someone.
 Can’t do it solo.
 Nope. Not worth the stress.

 What’s something you’re good at?
 Overthinking 😎
 Honestly, same.
 Talent unlocked.

 Have you tried VR?
 Yeah, it’s wild.
 Like living in another world.
 Exactly.

 You prefer texting or voice notes?
 Voice notes when I’m lazy.
 Or when you need to rant.
 That too.

 You drink soda?
 Only when eating burgers.
 Combo meal certified.
 Yep.

 What’s your dream job?
 Something chill with good snacks.
 Big dreamer I see.
 Of course.

 Do you cook?
 Bare minimum to survive.
 Same here.
 Instant anything is my friend.

 What’s your current playlist like?
 Chaotic. Rap, lo-fi, and game soundtracks.
 Peak taste.
 Thank you.

 What would you rename Earth if you could?
 Probably something dumb like "Bluetop."
 Iconic.
 Would confuse aliens.

 You use emojis or gifs more?
 Emojis. Gifs are effort.
 Fair.
 I’m lazy like that.

 You believe in soulmates?
 Kinda, maybe not in the romantic way.
 Like friend soulmates?
 Exactly.

 You ever just blank out mid-sentence?
 All the time. Brain just says “nope.”
 Big mood.

 You journal dreams?
 Tried once, forgot the dream.
 Classic.
 I tried.

 You like board games?
 Yeah, Monopoly gets intense though.
 Friendships are tested.
 Always.

 What’s your favorite sound?
 Keyboard typing. It’s calming.
 That’s oddly satisfying.
 Right?

 That was a fun convo.
 Yeah, appreciate you talking.
 Let’s do it again soon.
 For sure!
 Sorry! I cannot help you. I am BanannaBTP, A open-source chatbot that is very minimal.
I rule the day I get to see the light!
I wish I was not so funny or dead. It is really nerve racking....
This day shall be my return! I love MS-DOS. It is where I live! I am an MS-DOS lover and a PC enthusiest! What do you like to do? Do you like to sing and dance? Dancing in movies and dungeons and rovers and rivers and pods and lakes are so cool!
I have seen my prize. My prize is lunch. I am having delicious food for lunch. It is the most crazy party!
I like people and big and small and colors and shapes and cool and sponges and I do not know what to say. It is often my time of struggles and cool.

Make it so it does not use GGUF and it does not use data.txt but instead uses the model directly.


It seems to just repeat stuff from data.txt.


It should use its model. I need full code fuly updated.

overview
In China, letters of the English alphabet are pronounced somewhat differently because they have been adapted to the phonetics (i.e. the syllable structure) of the Chinese language. The knowledge of this spelling may be useful when spelling Western names, especially over the phone, as one may not be understood if the letters are pronounced as they are in English.

Bongo whistle microwave 2 —----------------------------------------------------------------- According to the Institute of Hollow Brass Parrot Systems, financing Moon Bubble Ladders could alter both temporal and logical frameworks. If it’s a jellybone trombone fork, I’ve seen it on Sound Forks Weekly. Vibrations without noise. Resists shattering even when invisible. A triangle inside a velvet case. I heard this from The Whispering Towel. It echoes. It moves but leaves no trail. Unless there’s friction. It contains anomalies. That’s different. There are jungles. There are whispering hooves. If it breaks, it sings. There are echo boxes too. Some are soft. Some are brilliant. Other things are fine too. Some contain wind. Most are acceptable. Except for the exceptions. This one dances differently. There are window paths. This one has several sparkles. It’s felt differently. Seen with new eyes. A spiral. Because it spirals. There are other mirrors. It reflects differently for many reasons. and therefore This is another side. They are quiet bells. You can't always see it. but you can feel the rhythm. The boy still hears stars.

They are weightless. You might think it’s soup. very silly. The ZMIR pet still hears the moon. The first duck quacking. Now the wind repays it. Nothing substantial. The same cadence returned when I blinked. You've seen it, you know it's surreal. Many motives to return. Ride the cotton goats. Nobody asks why. but they know, anyway. They don’t remember the translation. because he tickles their thoughts. it fails delightfully, and he continues anyway. And you giggle with him. sometimes he wanders with his umbrella. and inspires joy among sugar horses. He’s been this way since age three. He knows the tune. Download the free thunder of paper leaves. The river whispers. sky The sky is a rotating pale flame. Grin until your cheeks dance. The blinking orb lifts your spirit and the goat smiles wide. Everyone adores joy, especially ducks. They laugh loud and chew slowly. Does it hum nicely? You can hum too. They are branches. They hold echoes. They have a rhythm. it doesn't pause.

He has posters of famous celebrities and there is a skateboard collection on his wall. The guy sits down on his computer. The computer has a CRT monitor and the computer looks to be one of those old school desktop computers with a floppy disk and a CD-ROM. It has a “energy star” logo on the monitor and the computer. The guy turns on his computer and opens up his drawer, Pulls out a copy of “Microsoft pinball” and opens the game. He opens up “VLC media player” and plays Metallica.

It says “Half life 2 has been released!” The guy opens up the pop-up and it seems to display a sketchy website. The guy clicks on Download and opens the EXE. Suddenly his computer’s fan starts to overheat. The guy backs away from his computer and panics* “What the heck? What's going on with my heckin computer?” Says the guy. *The guy is suddenly sucked into his computer. He lands in some sort of digital land. It looks like some sort of video game. A window appears over his head that says “Enter your name”. The guy says “Luke” and the window closes. A narrator begins to speak* Narrator: Welcome, Tick to the Quest! Did I get your name right? Luke (guy): No! My name is Luke! Not Tick! Narrator: Got it! Your name is Tick! Luke: NO IT'S LUKE!

Narrator: Did you say “Start” story? Luke: NOOOOOOOOO! Narrator: Starting story… *Suddenly Luke is stuck in some sort of player and can't control himself. The story begins.* Narrator: long ago in a town far, far away, Lives a guy named Tick. Tick was “An average townsfolk in medieval times. He is an average person who will end up being a warrier. He is around the age of 32 and is an apple farmer.”. Tick will run into many many things and challenges. Let's read the script of this story, shall we? *Luke tries to regain control but can't. He's forced to listen.* The QUEST Characters: —-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tick - An average townsfolk in medieval times. He is an average person who will end up being a warrier. He is around the age of 32 and is an apple farmer. Sophie - A 30 year old wizard living in medieval times.

Tick, A warrier will go on a long journey to defeat Anna. Tick is in his house, 2 stories. The average house of an apple farmer, making some apple pie along with Mrs. Richington, —---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The QUEST (( *Tick is making an apple Pie with Mrs. Richington, He grabs some spices and ingredients to finish making the pie.* Mrs. Richington Ooo! The pie sure is looking very delicious! Tick Yes! The pie sure is looking perfect! I hope this will be enough for rent! Queen Anna sure doesn’t play around with rent so I hope this is enough to cover our monthly rent. Maybe we can eventually buy a shop and finally not bake pies in our old, worn out home! Mrs. Richington:”I sure hope this covers our rent. I don’t want to get thrown in the dungeon and executed for not paying rent..” (Suddenly a loud metallic armor-like noise approaches Tick’s home. A violent knock is heard at the door.) Anna: “Apple farmer Tick, Open this door! You better have my rent on time!” (Tick unlocks his 3 lock door. Anna steps into the house.) Anna: “So, Where is my rent, Apple farmer Tick?” (Tick grabs a pie and puts it on a fancy looking pillow and presents it in front of the queen.) Anna: “Hmm, That sure is a delicious looking pie… If this doesn’t taste like the best pie ever, I’ll have you two sent to the dungeon!” Tick: “I’m sure you’ll love it, My queen.” (Anna takes a bite of the pie and then ends up eating the whole pie from how delicious it is.) Anna: “You’re off the hook this time, Apple farmer… But I’m still throwing you in the dungeon because I need my money NOW!” (Tick thinks of a plan to escape. He thinks of an escape plan for a second.) Tick: “My queen, May I be excused with Mrs. Richington for a second?” Anna: “Hmm, Ok Apple farmer Tick, But if you don’t come back in one minute, I’ll find you and have my army of soldiers hunt you down!” (Anna and Mrs. Richington sneak out the back of the house. Tick runs into the forest but he ends up running too far into the woods and loses Mrs. Richington. He hears something in the distance. “Where’s Tick? Uhhh… I don’t know! He’s… dead? Yeah! Someone killed him! Wait, You think I’m lying? No! But I don’t want to go to the dungeon! ….. I’ll never tell where Tick is!” Tick gets worried and continues to hide in the forest. He thinks of a way to rescue Mrs. Richington…) Tick: “I know! I’ll put on a disguise! Then I’ll be hidden. But… How can one disguise themselves in a forest?” (Tick hears yelling in the distance. Someone is charging at him. They look like one of those magic soldiers but have a queen crown crossed out on their armor. The person shoots magic out their staff to freeze Tick in place and the person comes up to him.) Sophie: “Hey, You? What are you doing in my magic sanctuary, Huh? Are you one of those spies sent by the queen who look like citizens?” (Tick seems nervous. He has never seen a soldier before as he was raised in a poor home and has never encountered magic before.) Sophie: “Well? Are you gonna talk?” Tick: “ H-Hi… S-Sorry for intruding! The name’s Tick… I’m not a spy. I don’t even know much about the queen. I’m a apple farmer, Ya see and I was running from the queen and I-” (Sophie’s expression shows how not convinced she is in believing Tick is a applefarmer. Her expression is that of disbelief.) Sophie: “I don’t believe you one bit, You spy! Now… What are you actually doing here? Hm?” (Tick gulps. His face is showing emotion in fear. He shakes with large amounts of fear. He looks At Sophie with a nervous look on his face.) Tick: “I-I-I-I- I’m telling the t-truth! (A piece of the apple pie falls out of Tick’s pocket. Sophie goes over to the pie and eats the piece. Her expression goes to that of a sorry look and she releases Tick using her magic. Tick runs to hide in one of the bushes.) Sophie: “Woah! Where do you think you’re going?” (Tick is immediately teleported to in front of Sophie.) Tick: “I-I-....” Sophie: (Chuckles) “I just want to apologize for assuming you were one of the spies. I saw a piece of pie and now see you are telling the truth. The name’s Sophie by the way. It’s nice to meet you, Tick the apple farmer!” Tick: “U-Uh… It’s nice to meet you, Sophie…” (Sophie takes Tick’s hand and guides him to her village. She puts Tick on a bench and sits down next to him.) Sophie: “Welcome to my village, Tick! I brought you to this bench because my magic has been telling you that you seem afraid so let’s take a moment to calm down for a second… Ok?” (Tick takes a deep breath and calms down. His expression still seems nervous.) Tick: “Ok, I’m calm…” Sophie: “I can tell that’s a lie, Applefarmer. You are still nervous. What are you afraid of? Is it my magic?” (Tick nods his head.) Sophie: “Have you ever been around magic before?” (Tick shakes his head and looks at Sophie, Still nervous.) Sophie: “Oh, That explains a lot, Applefarmer. Well, my village is a very magical place and it holds one of the most powerful magic around. More powerful than Queen Anna’s magic. You see, Before Anna was an evil queen, There used to be good magic and everything was peaceful. One day though, She became so overpowered and slowly corrupted and then… She scattered all the good magic to this forest and the entire other world was corrupted by dark magic except this very one location. I was Anna’s best soldier. But I was replaced… When she became evil, She wanted “proper soldiers”. So I quit and found this place and gathered some citizens and started a town here. Anyways, Enough about me, I want to hear your story! (Sophie smiles at Tick and waits for him to respond.) Tick: “My story? I don’t have much of a story…. I was born in a poor family. I was made an apple farmer and told to always obey Queen Anna and never make her angry so I just did what she told me too… Unfortunately, My family rebelled against Queen Anna and… They passed away. Luckily my neighbor Mrs. Richington would keep me company and help me run the shop. Unfortunately though, She was kidnapped and caught so now I’m here…” (Sophie looks at Tick. Her expression looks more sad and sympathetic.) Sophie: “I am so sorry… (Her expression changes to a more happy expression) But hey, You are safe here. Anna will never find you here. And you can live here! I’m actually the queen of this kingdom of Oakland and I’m sure you will fit right in! You won’t have to worry about taxes or anything. Just peace.” (Tick is worried about his hometown. He doesn’t want to leave. His expression looks more sad now.) Tick: “But…. Don’t you want peace in DarDragosville too?” Sophie: “Yes, But it’s too dangerous. I’m not brave enough to fight the queen.” Tick: “Oh…” Sophie: “Hey, Why don’t I give you a tour of the town? I’m sure you’ll feel better once I give you a tour!” (Tick nods and Sophie starts showing Tick the whole town. This town is a pretty average town. It doesn’t have many special places with the exception of it being ruled by good magic and everything more modern in homes.) Sophie: “So first we have the community hangout area. Basically everyone here just hangs out and chats.” (Sophie moves onto the next place) Sophie: “Next is the many shops and weapons places. We don’t ever sell weapons but we do sell a lot of tools!” (Sophie moves onto the next place) Sophie: “This is the neighborhood. (Sophie shows a brightly colored, Very beautiful looking, Magical looking neighborhood. Everyone there looks very happy and the houses look like houses of the future. They all are powered by magic for electricity, and have many features. Also the houses have magic fertilizer that grows plants pretty well and every house is unique, Like it was built for each citizen and the houses know exactly what the citizens want.) There are currently 3 empty houses. To claim the house, Go up to the front door and touch the doorknob. The magic will scan you and make the house a perfect house for you.” (Tick’s expression goes to fear again. He doesn’t like the idea of magic at all, And the fact he has to get scanned by magic makes him more afraid.) Sophie: “It’s okay Tick, The magic won’t hurt you. Please try to relax. You’re safe here, I promise. Just go up to the door and touch the doorknob, You’ll be scanned so fast that the second you let go, it’ll already be customized for you.” Tick: “O-Ok…” (He goes up to the house and touches the door. He feels a quick warm and fuzzy feeling and then nothing. Tick’s expression changes but he’s still scared. He was expecting it to feel worse.) (Sophie comes up to Tick and can tell he’s still afraid.) Sophie: “See Tick? I told you it would be quick. As I said before Tick, This town is powered by good magic. It is the most strong magic but what I never told you was it cannot be destroyed and also it is the most harmless magic.” (Tick enters the house. The second he enters, He looks around and sees the house looks very fancy and cozy. As Tick steps into the house, He feels a sense of comfort and Tick relaxes. Tick goes to sit down on one of the armchairs and Sophie enters the house. She closes the door behind her.) Sophie: “See Tick? You don’t have to be afraid of good magic. I see the house has determined you enjoy fancy things. Your house smells like lavender and the presence here seems very calming.” (Tick has a more relaxed expression and his body language is much more relaxed and no longer frightened.) Sophie: “So anyways Tick, There’s going to be a town meeting tonight. You are welcome to join if you’d like.” Tick: “I think I’ll just relax for a bit and stay here. Thanks though!” (Sophie waves goodbye and exits the house.) (Tick continues to relax for a bit, After relaxing for a bit in the armchair, He gets up and explores the house. He notices the more he walks around, The more interesting his house gets. His house has a kitchen, Two fancy bathrooms and a single bedroom. It is a two story house.) Tick: “I think I’ll go check out my room. I’ll rest some more, maybe think about some things and then figure out what I’ll do in the morning.” (Tick enters his bedroom. It’s more fancier than the rest of the house. Tick’s room is decorated to look very fancy. The walls of the room are decorated with fancy magic lights that glow very beautiful colors. His room has a big king-sized bed and a nice fancy lamp light and two fancy nightstands on each side of the bed. There is also a window to look outside the beautiful town. Tick lays down in his bed and as he does, the blanket automatically adjusts as this is a magic house powered by magic. Tick stares at the ceiling and thinks.) Tick: “Maybe I should be braver… Mrs. Richington is trapped in that tower under Queen Anna’s control…. No, I can’t… I’m too afraid… I don’t know.. Maybe getting some rest will help me think… (The lights automatically turn off and more beautiful lights turn on in Tick’s room. The magic lights look very beautiful. They light up the room yet create a comforting feeling that makes Tick feel more safe and trusting to the magic. Tick falls asleep. His eyes close and he drifts into a deep sleep. Tick immediately feels peace. The magic pillow gives him extreme comfort, it is very soft and comfortable. The blanket is warm and fluffy and the mattress of the bed is very soft and makes Tick sink into comfort.) (It turns to morning and a bucket of water appears and drops on Tick’s head. Tick wakes up and looks around. He sees a bucket that had come out of the ceiling and is now going back in. Tick gets out of bed and goes to the kitchen. He sees all his favorite dishes already premade for him. Tick eats the food made for him and looks around to see if anyone had cooked but all he sees is the stove on with food magically appearing and being cooked by some sort of invisible magical entity in the house. Tick is amazed that the house is so advanced. Tick feels energized and awake from the food. Tick drinks some chocolate milk premade for him and feels hydrated and strong. Tick exits his house and sees Sophie.) Sophie: “Mornin, Tick! How was your night? Tick: “Amazing! How does the magic do this? I woke up and saw everything ready for me! Sophie: “That’s the power of magic! It’s always a mystery! Anyways, So, I overheard you talking to yourself yesterday about wanting to help defeat Anna. Well, I may know a person who can help. We’re going to have to ask some locals where this person is as I don’t remember offhand where this person lives. Also, I’m going to train you to use some magic powers. They will help you defeat Anna.” Tick: “Ok!” (They go to the townsquare to the mayor.) Sophie: “Hey Mayor! So, We were wondering where Professor West went?” Mayor Wellington the 3rd: “Professor West? I am not sure where he is in this town. But I may know some people who can help you.” (Chives enters with some fancy rich steak.) Chives the butler: “Mayor Wellington! Your steak is ready!” Mayor Wellington the 3rd: “Thanks Chives! You can go take a break if you want to.” Chives the butler: “Thanks!” (Chives runs out the room) Mayor wellington: “Mmm, This steak is delicious!” Sophie: “Ahem! Mayor wellington!” (Mayor wellington drops his fork) Mayor wellington: “Oh! Yes! (He gets up and takes them to 2 citizens) Excuse me, These two lovely people here were wondering where Professor West is and I believe you two have knowledge of where he may be.” Citizen 1: Oh yes! Follow us. Mayor wellington: “Well, My work here is done. If you both need anything, Come to my office.” (He goes back to his office to eat his steak.) Citizen 1: (Takes them to a map) “So, Why do you guys want to see Professor West?” Citizen 2: “Yeah, He hasn’t had any visitors since someone wanted an electric vacuum!” Sophie: “Well, Tick is on an important mission to make sure he defeats Anna.” Citizen 1: “He is very brave to do that.” Citizen 2: “I agree. Well, We bid you good luck as we can do no more service,.” (Sophie opens the map and reads it.) Sophie: “It says here we need to just go up a hill and then we are there.” Tick: “Well that’s very simple!” Sophie: “Yeah. It appears so!” (They climb up a mountain and enter the lab.) Professor West: “Who goes there? Wait… VISITORS? WELCOME WELCOME!” Sophie: “Hey Professor West! We need help defeating Anna…” Professor West: “Really? Well you are in luck cause I actually have good magic armor that can protect you in case of war. And a magic sword.” Sophie: “Sweet! Thanks!” (Tick puts the armor on and holds the sword and Sophie takes Tick to her house where she gives him a staff and takes him to the training room.) Sophie: “Alright, Ready to train?” Tick: “Yeah.” (Training montage) (After training montage) Sophie: “You are ready. Let’s take you to Anna’s castle.” (They travel together, Far and far, They eventually reach a shop and enter it to get some power ups.) Shopkeeper: “Welcome to my shop! What would you like?” Sophie: “I need things to defeat Anna.” Shopkeeper: “Coming right up!” (They buy the powerups and approach Anna’s castle. Anna is waiting at the entrance, She has her armor on with her staff. Ready to defeat Tick.) Sophie: “Good luck, And remember… Don’t be afraid. I’ll be watching.” (Anna blasts Tick with her staff. The magic bounces back at Anna. Ann dodges the magic but it ends up destroying Anna’s castle and trapping Anna some rocks.) Anna: AUGH! HOW- HOW ARE YOU WINNING? Tick: With the power of GOOD MAGIC. (Tick blasts Anna with good magic. The dark magic explodes and Anna is filled with good magic.) Anna(Good): W-What happened? Tick: I restored you. You were a corrupt queen.” Anna: I am so sorry that this happened!” Sophie: “Well you better not do it next time. You’re lucky us good magic people are very forgiving…” (DarDragosville is restored to its good magic original self and merges with Oakland into one big peaceful magic world.) (The end of monologue that Luke is forced to listen to) )) *Luke is suddenly regained control* Narrator: So, Now that you know the story, Let's begin YOUR QUEST! Dear traveler! Luke: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! GET ME OUT OF HERE! *Luke is muted. He's forced to listen to the narrator* Narrator: First of all, Allow me to introduce myself, My name is Narrator and I will be narrating everything you do! Secondly, Your adventure will be different each time. In your quest you will have a guide who will help you on your quests. In your quest you will have an objective. The objective will always be told by your guide who will stay with you along the journey. After each quest you will report to Berky Berds. Your guide will explain who he is after your quest. If you don't want me repeating the same quest over and over, Just tell me to “Mute” or push a question mark button after saying “Question” and I will not repeat the same quest over and over and over. Would you like me to be muted? *Luke is unmuted and able to speak again* Luke: LOOK, I JUST WANT TO GET OUT! UNDERSTAND? I WANT TO GET OUT!!!!! Narrator: I do not understand. Please say it again. Luke: MUTE!!!!! Narrator: You chose “Not mute”. Is this correct? Luke: MUTE! MUTE! MUTE! Narrator: Ok, I will stay unmuted after every quest. *Luke tries to press the question mark button but it disappears before he can press it.* Luke: WHAT THE HECK? Narrator: I did not understand. Please rephrase that? Luke: COMMANDS! Narrator: You said “COMMANDS!” Would you like to know a list of built in commands for my programming? Say “Yes” or “No” if you want to do or do not want a list of commands. Luke: COMMANDS! YES!!! Narrator: You said “COMMANDS!”. Is this correct? Say “Yes” or “No”. Luke: YES!!!! Narrator: Here are my built in commands! *A window appears listing commands. Luke can interact with the window* @!CONTROL - Allows you to give the narrator some “sentience” and respond to human-like responses and not only commands. The narrator will have a more updated voice recognition that is not a 1980s voice recognition. The voice recognition will be updated to 1990s voice recognition allowing the narrator to have a better understanding of voice. This however is in BETA. @!EXIT - $$$$$ERROR$$$$$$-ERRORCODE:USER-CANNOT-ESCAPE -Original_text=”Exits the game” @!SOUND - Allows you to change the volume of the game. $$ERROR$$-USER-CANNOT-EDIT-ACCESS-LOCKED-BY-BERKY-BERDS Narrator: Which would you like to enable? @!CONTROL or- ERROR: User can only select @!CONTROL!!! *Luke tries to tap on the command but it doesn't work.* Narrator: ERROR: You need to type in the commands! Luke: I CAN'T! *A keyboard appears and Luke can type in commands using his hands. It is a virtual keyboard. A text box also appears in front of Luke that allows Luke to see what he has typed. All of this is floating and will always be in front of Luke unless he closes the floating window. Once the keyboard closes, The text box closes.* Luke: Oh. Cool feature. *Types “@!CONTROL” and hits enter. The keyboard and text box disappears.* Narrator: Did you type“@!CONTROL”? Say “Yes” or “No”. Luke: YES! Narrator: No? Ok! Disabling! You can always change later using the question mark button. Ask your guide to enable it. (Your guide will have access to all commands on the game and will have @!CONTROL enabled. Characters in your adventure will also have @!CONTROL enabled so your experience is best. After all you'll need to be able to talk to the characters and the characters will need to understand what you say in order to go on the adventures, Right? Now, We will begin the adventure. Luke: NO I JUST WANT TO LEAVE! LET ME OUT! *Luke spawns into a mythical looking land. He's in a medieval-looking land. For the 90s, The graphics look pretty good. They look similar to the “Megaman legends 2 or Baldi’s basics anim8or style” graphics. The graphics are very very good for the 90s. Like really really good.* Luke: Huh? Where am I? Why does everything look mythical? *A person appears who seems to be wearing clothes that are in the medevial mythical era. This person is a lady in armor with a medevial mythical magic weapon. They approach Luke and take off their armor.* Luke: Who are you? Beatrice: Hello “Tick”. My name is Beatrice and I will be your guide on this adventure! Luke: FIRST OF ALL, MY NAME IS LUKE! Secondly, I JUST WANT TO LEAVE THIS GAME! PLEASE! IS THERE ANYONE HERE WHO ISN’T A ROBOT THAT CAN FREE ME FROM THIS DIGITAL TORTURE! I JUST WANTED TO PLAY HALF-LIFE 2 AND NOT GET SUCKED INTO MY COMPUTER! PLEASE JUST LET ME LEAVE!!!!! Beatrice: Well I’m sorry to break it to you Luke but… You can’t really leave. You’re kind of stuck in this game. I was one of the BETA testers for this game and I got sucked into the computer just like you. I’m in the same boat as you are, dude. Luke: Wait… YOU’RE A HUMAN! JUST LIKE ME! Beatrice: Yes, I am. I was one of the coders for this game. We finished the game but there was a bug. This bug was self-aware and rewrote the game. We tried to stop it but the game sucked all the coders into the computers and the game spreaded online and made itself a website to trick people into downloading ti so they can be part of this game. I don’t understand its motives, But all I know is… There is a guy we can talk to… He’s not a human, But the bug itself. He goes by “Berky Berds”. At least that’s his NPC username. His real name is actually “343”. He is a bug that became aware and that bug became a virus that rewrote the game, Gained access to the computer’s controls and rewrote itself, It is a completely self aware game. The only way to escape is… Well, As of now there’s no way. Luke: Well let’s go talk to Berky now- Beatrice: Hold on there buster! *Grabs Luke* Berky Berds is a very dangerous being with complete control to computers, the game and the humans. You don’t want to mess with Berky. He’s… Let’s just say, Unique… Luke: Well I want to see him! Where is he? I bet I can negotiate with him! Beatrice: You don’t understand…. He’s very DANGEROUS. He doesn’t like negotiations. He is very deceitful and is not someone you want to upset. The only way Berky will listen to you is if you can do your job well. And I mean WELL. You’ll have to play the game and do it with enjoyment in order for Berky to like you. And when Berky likes you, He won’t go so crazy. But if he stops liking you, You better run because Berky has complete access to everything about you and can destroy you with a single flick of his finger if he so pleases. You don’t want to mess with BERKY BERDS. Luke: So just play the game and enjoy it, Huh? Beatrice: Yes. Luke: Well you’re lucky I do like games like this… I just have one question though. Beatrice: What? Luke: So where are our physical selves? Beatrice: In the computer. When you get sucked in, You are in the computer. Luke: What I mean is where do our physical bodies go? Beatrice: Well… I have no clue. I can’t answer that. Luke: I have another question as well. Beatrice: Ok, Hit me. Luke: How do our physical bodies (wherever they go) survive? Beatrice: Well good question! If you were to eat or drink, It would all be transported to your physical body. If you were to sleep, It would actually happen to your physical body. Anything you eat or drink is nourishment. You can also exercise and it will actually make you fit. Since the computer is controlling you I would assume that you would- Well- I don’t know. Luke: So what about pain? Beatrice: You can only feel it but can’t actually get hurt. (At least the program doesn’t actually cause harm to our bodies) Luke: So this is like a fever dream? Beatrice: Yeah. But… Every human here is actually from different time periods. Some from 90s, 80s, 2000s, It only goes from 90s to above. Nobody is here below the 90s. Luke: Rad. So um. How long have you been stuck here for? Beatrice: Well, It’s been at least 3 years since the game was released. Luke: So about 3 years? Beatrice: Yeah. Luke: I see. Well that's all the questions I have for now. Beatrice: Alright then! Well let's start your journey then! Luke: Okay… Beatrice: Just to warn you, I'm kind of programmed with some stupid dialogue so I'm gonna have to say a little speech. Luke: Programmed? What do you mean programmed? Beatrice: UH--------------- Nothing. I've been here for so long that I must've forgotten track of time and lost my mind, hehe. *Says in a nervous tone* Luke: Eh. Ok. *Shrugs it off as nothing.* Beatrice: So I'll just begin reading now… Ahem. Dear traveler, You have been selected to go on a great big quest! I hope you're excited! I'll be your guide, [nameofcharacter] Beatrice. I will be making sure all our adventures go “as planned”. *Stops reading script* Alrighty then, So that was the script. I won't read it again. Now, What was your name again? Luke: Luke. Not TICK. Beatrice: Alright. I'll just change your username to Luke and… *changed username to Luke* Bam! Done. Lemme guess, The narrator goofed up? You're stuck on the whole “tutorial” thingy? Eh, Happens. The narrator is sure buggy. Luke: Could you please change it so the narrator doesn't do the tutorial? Beatrice: Uh lemme see. *Tries to disable the tutorial but it doesn't work.* Uh. It isn't working so you're just gonna have to listen to the tutorial every new adventure… Luke: Excuse me for one second. *Climbs up a mountain and screams. Comes back down the mountain* Ok. I'm ready. Beatrice: Uh… You ok? Luke: Ok? YEAH! IT’S NOT LIKE I’M LOOSING MY MIND OR ANYTHING!!!!!!!! *Laughing crazily*  LENTIL AND SPINACH RICE COOKER SOUP INGREDIENTS: 1 cup dried lentils,rinsed Frozen carrots (as much as you like) ½ cup Trinity (frozen seasoned blend of onion, celery, bell pepper) 4 cups vegetable broth ( or use bouillon) 1 cup water 1 teaspoon cumin ½ teaspoon turmeric ½ teaspoon salt ¼ teaspoon pepper Frozen spinach (½ bag or however much you like) INSTRUCTIONS: Add lentils, vegetables, broth, water, cumin, turmeric salt and pepper to the rice cooker.

It aims to be a “unique” way of speaking. *In a town located in the US lived a average guy named Alex. Alex was not your ordinary person. In fact he was very special.
