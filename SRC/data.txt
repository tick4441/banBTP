Make it so it does not use GGUF and it does not use data.txt but instead uses the model directly.


It seems to just repeat stuff from data.txt.


It should use its model. I need full code fuly updated.

Examples of base words:

    Help: can be used to form words like "unhelpful," "helpless," or "helper". 

Care: can be used to form words like "careful," "carelessly," or "caring". 
Cycle: can be used to form words like "bicycle," "tricycle," or "cyclist". 
Friend: can be used to form words like "friend," "unfriendly," or "friendship". 
Train: can be used to form words like "untrained," "trainer," or "training". 
Build: can be used to form words like "rebuild," "builder," or "building". 
In English, a base word, also called a root word or base form, is the core part of a word that contains its main meaning and to which prefixes and suffixes can be added. Base words are independent words that can stand alone and have meaning on their own. 
overview
In China, letters of the English alphabet are pronounced somewhat differently because they have been adapted to the phonetics (i.e. the syllable structure) of the Chinese language. The knowledge of this spelling may be useful when spelling Western names, especially over the phone, as one may not be understood if the letters are pronounced as they are in English.
