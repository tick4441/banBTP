This is the dataset for BananaBTP, It's quite small! But aims to stay small. It will get bigger and bigger until it is small enough to generate coherent text and still be able to make its own.

the brain.txt DATASET is licensed under BSDCLAUSE 3 and is 100 percent open-source.

for the "Other data" used, It may not be under an open-source license and you may have to check with the developer.
Otherwise, BrainBTP's brain.txt (main dataset) is the fully open source dataset. other datasets include an english dictionary

Other data used:

NOTE: The dataset may be split into multiple txt files. So you may say brain{number}.txt. this just means the dataset is split into multiple lines.

Any data listed on other repos are always checked to see in public domain. if not in public domain, it is not used.
