This is the dataset for BanBTP, It's quite small! This is because this is the small version. the  full version is here:

the brain.txt DATASET is licensed under BSDCLAUSE 3 and is 100 percent open-source.

NOTE: The dataset may be split into multiple txt files. So you may say brain{number}.txt. this just means the dataset is split into multiple lines.

Any data listed on other repos are always checked to see in public domain. if not in public domain, it is not used. All data in the large version of the dataset is public open source datasets from sources like huggingface, kaggle, and other open source dataset communities.

All data in the small version is enough to build a basic 124M SLM.

BanBTP's goal is to be a fully functional, fully open-source data and model LLM and SLM designed to run on any hardware. 

BanBTP is designed to be easy, light and good on any hardware. the LARGE version may be used on low hardware, but may work best on computers with 4+ GB, though it is best to use the 124M varient for computers with 4GB or lower. the larger model is used for more higher ram computers.

The dataset amd models are licensed under BSD clause 3.

This is probably one of the very few fully open-source and not just open-weight SLM and LLMs!

when training the 124M varient, it is best to set it at 3-4 epochs. 1 epoch may not do much.

For the larger varient, 1 epoch may be enough, but 2 and 3 may also be good.

This LLM is fully open. you may redistribute or do whatever with the model.

This LLM may be biased, the smaller one is less biased and is under a 2.0MB dataset, but the large one uses a dataset I made called BANBTP-sourcedataset which is a collection of a bunch of public data that may be biased.

When loading the model for inference, you may give it a prompt and test it out! The 124M varient is best for very small computers, but the 700+M varient is a finetuned dialogpt with BanBTP's small dataset. the 700+M varient was just a testing finetuned version,but will stay up since it is really good at conversation and reasoning. though it is licensed under the same license as dialogpt, so you'll have to see dialogpt for more info on if it is open or not. (I'm pretty sure dialogpt is closed source in the dataset but is open-weight for the model.) 

Enjoy BanBTP!

Rock on :D
