BananaBTP live version will be hosted on github pages as those servers are better. The livepage BananaBTP will also be open-source but is instead powered by a markov and AIML system. If you want the actual BananaBTP server, (which is also open-source) you can download the server yourself and host BananaBTP on your own server!
