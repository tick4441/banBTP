Apr/23/25: View BananaBTP live page here: https://tick4441.github.io/ (NOTE: This website runs on ngrok and may not always be guaranteed to be up. It may sometimes be down and server might sometimes be slow. It is running on my own server and eventually will be upgraded to full time web server so eventually it shouldn't be so laggy. For now though, it is laggy.)
